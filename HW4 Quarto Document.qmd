## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#The purpose of the lapply() function is to apply the function to lists. According to the slideshow, the purpose is to "obtain a list object". An example as provided by the slideshow:
#set.seed(10) 
#my_list <- list(rnorm(100), runif(10), rgamma(40, shape = 1, rate = 1))
#Apply mean() function to each list element
#To give additional arguments to FUN we add them on afterward
#The purrr equivalent of it would probably be "map" as it "always returns a list", according to one of the slides.
#map(my_list, mean)
```

```{r}
#list(cor(x, y, method = “kendall”))
```

```{r}
#The purrr() package provides a tidyverse alternative to the apply() family.
#Providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.

```

```{r}
#In R, a transformation naturally returns the naturally modified argument (df). While, side-effects don't. Instead, they silently return the solution using the "invisible()".
```

```{r}
#In regards to the "sd" function, when you call a function, it creates temporary function environments. And this also explains why variables in functions don't exist outside of the functions.
```

```{r}
standardize <- getRMSE((vector, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
  {  predictors <- vector1  
    responses <- vector2
}
  return(list(result = vector, predictors  = vector1, responses = vector2))
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
n <- 100
x <- runif(n)
resp <- 3 + 10*x + rnorm(n)
pred <- predict(lm(resp ~ x), data.frame(x))
```

```{r}
standardize <- getMAE((vector, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
  {  predictors <- vector1  
    responses <- vector2
}
  return(list(result = vector, predictors  = vector1, responses = vector2))
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
n <- 100
x <- runif(n)
resp <- 3 + 10*x + rnorm(n)
pred <- predict(lm(resp ~ x), data.frame(x))
```

```{r}
standardize <- getMAE((vector, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
  {  predictors <- vector1  
    responses <- vector2
}
  return(list(result = vector, predictors  = vector1, responses = vector2))
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
n <- 100
x <- runif(n)
resp <- 3 + 10*x + rnorm(n)
pred <- predict(lm(resp ~ x), data.frame(x))
```
